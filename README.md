  
## WMIMon

This command line tool allows to monitor WMI activity on Windows platform.

If you don't have Visual Studio to build it, you can download binaries from https://github.com/luctalpe/WMIMon/blob/master/Downloads/WMIMon_Binaries.zip

# Features

It is a real-time ETL consumer for the WMI-Activity event log channel.
It will allow to also get information about the WMI client process (executable).
You can specify a regular expression to filter and limit output to a specific executable,username,client computername, Process ID,query. 

# Scenarios

This tool may be useful for several scenarios:
- Finding which executable/computer/user are executing specific queries and putting load on your system
- Learn WMI queries done by your components or a component tha you need to troubleshoot
- Execute a specific script when a WMI error code is returned to a client

# Sample 1

- Allow to view all WMI activity
```

```
# Sample 2

- Will monitor all queries containing CreateSnaphost. When this query is executed, the prowershell script listvar.ps1 is executed.This script will display all WMIMON powershell variable and will display informations for the WMI current process ($WMIMOM_PID variable)

```
PS C:\temp\WMIMon> type .\listvar.ps1
ls variable:WMI*
get-process -ID $WMIMON_PID


PS C:\temp\WMIMon> .\WMIMon.exe "-filter=.*Virtual.*CreateSnapshot" "-action=.\listvar.ps1"
Parsing:        filtering on .*virtual.*createsnapshot
Parsing:        Powershell action when filter is found : .\listvar.ps1

# Usage

- WMItrace.exe is a basic C++ version without any filtering capability
- WMIMON.exe is a .Net tool with all the features. You need to copy WMIMonC.dll in the same directory

```
c:\Temp>WMImon /?
Parsing:        Invalid argument /?


Usage:  WmiMon [-filter=regular_expression_string] [-stop=start|end|none] [-ifstopstatus=hexadecimal_value] [-log=all|filter] [action=pipeline]
                  default WmiMon [-filter=.*] [-stop=none] [-log=all]
will monitor WMI activity. By default all WMI activities are displayed.

You can filter the output with the -filter switch.

You can stop the application :
- if the filtering is successfull. Stop will occur at activity startup  if -stop=start is specified.
      If -stop=end is specified we will wait for the end of the activity to stop the monitoring
        Warning : if many records match the filtering pattern , memory usage  may increase
- if the filtering is successfull and _ifstopstatus condition is meet
    Warning : if many records match the filtering pattern , memory usage for this query may be hudge

For all filtered items or if a stop condition is meet , the pipeline action will be executed
Powershell variables WMIMON_* will be set in Powershell runspace to reflect the current WMI activity.
Your Powershell actions may use these variables (client PID, client computer, client user, stop status, WMI query,...)  

N.B: WMIMon is based on RealTime ETL notification. ETL infrastructure doesn't guarantee that all events will be received.
N.B: WMI Stop operation logging may occur after a delay based on client (get-cim* cmdlets cleanup occurs immediately
     This is not true with get-wmiobject cmdlet).
